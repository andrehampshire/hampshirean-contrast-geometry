# hampshirean-contrast-geometry
This work introduces a geometry derived from discernible contrast structure, rejecting pointwise assumptions in favor of neighborhood-level perception. The framework defines fields, curvature, and gradient from finite contrast relations, suitable for applications in perceptual geometry, mathematical physics, and structural epistemology.
