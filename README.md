**Hampshirean Contrast Geometry: A Structural Epistemology of Fields, Curvature, and Gradient**  
*by AndrÃ© Hampshire*

## ðŸ§  Description

This work introduces a foundational geometric framework built from discernible contrast structure, rejecting pointwise assumptions in favor of neighborhood-based appearance. In this model, curvature, intensity, and gradient arise structurally from finite contrast variations resolved across local neighborhoods, conditioned by an observerâ€™s resolution threshold.

Key features include:
- **Contrast field** definitions that replace pointwise values.
- **Internal and external intensity** as angular and radial curvature.
- **Contrast compass** and **emergent gradient direction** defined without differentiability.
- Consistency with classical gradient behavior in smooth cases.
- Application to perception, geometry, and the epistemology of physics.
